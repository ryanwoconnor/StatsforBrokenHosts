<h1>Panel Descriptions</h1>
<h2>Latest Event</h2>
Exactly what it sounds like. What time did the last event come in for this host?
<h2>Maximum Data Gap (By Host)</h2>
What was the maximum time between any two events in the selected time period? If no results were found, this means data has been sending at least once every 15 minutes. 
<h2>Average Data Gap (By Host)</h2>
What was the average time between any two events in the selected time period? If no results were found, this means data has been sending at least once every 15 minutes. 
<h2>Timechart of Data</h2>
A visualization of the number of events being sent over the selected time period. 
<h2>Analysis by Host/Index/Sourcetype</h2>
An advanced look at each Host/Sourcetype/Index combination for the selected host. This panel is clickable if you want to navigate over to an analysis of that sourcetype or index. 
<h2>Business Hour vs Non-Business Hour Senders</h2>
This panel will show you if your selected host sends more data during typical business hours, or during non-business hours. 
<h2>Weekend vs Weekday Senders</h2>
This panel will show you if your selected host sends more data during the weekend or weekdays.
